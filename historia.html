  <!-- una breve historia de la banda -->
  <main>
    <h1>El día a día de la Banda</h1>
    <div class="historiaDeLaBanda">
      <p>
        Last November, a jet-lagged Kodaline were driving into Pune, India,
        when a motorcyclist frantically flagged at them to pull over. Baffled
        by his urgency, they stopped at the side of a busy road. The reason?
        The man was a hardcore Kodaline fan and wanted to get a selfie with
        frontman Steve Garrigan. “We made his day or even his year,” laughs
        Garrigan. “He was so over the moon, it was great.”
      </p>
      <img class="imgHis" src="./img/k5.jpg" alt="foto del grupo">

      <p>
        Such scenes were replicated throughout their first tour of Asia. In
        India they headlined the NH7 Weekender in front of 22,000 people.
        Their first show in South Korea sold-out within a minute. A music
        teacher in Indonesia posted a video of his entire class performing
        their breakthrough favourite ‘All I Want’. And whether they were
        arriving in Malaysia, Singapore or Vietnam, they’d be met by fans
        thrusting gifts upon them.
      </p>
      <p>
        That devotion is an extension of the huge appeal they’ve demonstrated
        at home. Kodaline’s ability to capture intense emotions in
        arena-scaled songs gives their music a universal quality. It’s been
        proven already, with three number one albums in Ireland and two top
        ten hits in the UK. 2019 alone saw them add 283 million streams at
        Spotify, spread between 79 countries, despite not releasing any new
        material.
      </p>
      <p>

        Back home in Dublin, they sold-out two 15,000 capacity shows at St.
        Anne’s Park before playing to another 60,000 at Electric Picnic. The
        festival reached an emotional crescendo when Cranberries’ guitarist
        Noel Hogan joined Kodaline for ‘Zombie’, a whole-hearted tribute to
        the late Dolores O’Riordan. It also represented Kodaline going back to
        the beginning. Their first arena show came when the Cranberries
        invited them to open a gig in Paris back in 2012. All of which
        would’ve seemed impossible during the band’s modest early days in
        Dublin. Garrigan used to play gigs in local pubs, while he and
        guitarist Mark Prendergast used to busk together on Grafton Street.
        But Kodaline dreamed big, even if their rehearsal space was an
        abandoned school.
      </p>

      <p>
        “We’ve seen what it’s like to have no following, so we’re very
        grateful that the Irish have taken to us,” reflects Garrigan. “It’s
        our home and a place that we love.”
      </p>
                  <img class="imgHis1" src="./img/k6.jpg" alt="foto del grupo">
      <p>
        While touring kept Kodaline in the public eye in 2019, they dedicated
        much of the year to making new music. Their previous album, 2018’s
        ‘Politics of Living’, saw them travel around to work with various
        producers and songwriters. This time around they took a different
        approach. The majority of the process revolved around the four of them
        in their modest recording space in Dublin. And rather than work on it
        continually, they kept the sessions fresh by breaking for weekends and
        short tours.
      </p>
      <p>
        With bassist Jason Boland leading the production side of things, this
        streamlined process took them back to their roots. That method was
        only intended to a trial. “But we soon realised it was working really
        well,” says Prendergast. “The approach on our last album was a
        learning curve for us, but this was really natural.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The mission, says Garrigan, was to focus on the emotion that informs
        many Kodaline fan favourites. “The main thing this time was to capture
        those emotions through everything. And we all sing, so we wanted to
        use a lot of harmonies and play to our strengths.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Those strengths are immediately apparent in the album’s first single
        ‘Wherever You Are’. Opening with Garrigan’s expressive topline backed
        by little more than swirling vocal harmonies, Kodaline build up the
        track towards its dramatic denouement. “‘Wherever You Are’ is about
        loved ones staying in your heart and mind even when they’re not with
        you,” he explains. “I wrote it specifically for my girlfriend as due
        to being away on tour all the time, we never really get to see each
        other.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Kodaline will often spend over half the year away on tour. When
        they’re back home, they’re usually planning, writing or recording the
        next record. It can be tough but they’re content with the sacrifice,
        as Boland explains.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Our wives and girlfriends know this is what we’ve wanted to do since
        we were kids. We’re living our dreams and they’re 100% supportive.
        They’re happy that we get to do want we want to do for a living,
        because that’s rare.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Garrigan wrote another new track ‘Sometimes’ while stewing over the
        aftermath of a bad show. While it’s written about a very specific
        experience, it’s still about a relatable emotion: losing your
        perspective over a challenging moment, and then finding ways to cope
        with your anxiety. It’s a topic that Garrigan has recently shared,
        opening up about his struggles with panic attacks. There’s no easy
        answer, but addressing such issues is a positive start. “There’s an
        Irish mentality that men can’t show emotions and that’s bullshit.”
      </p>
      <p>
        While Garrigan and Prendergast’s experiences of anxiety and depression
        feed into some of the new songs, one of the highlights is pure
        fiction. Possessing a 1950s Rat Pack feel with sumptuous vocal
        harmonies, ‘Last Day on Earth’ explores the tale of a couple vowing to
        stay together as the world hurtles towards its final apocalypse.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Our music is now as emotional as it can be,” says drummer Vinny May
        with contagious enthusiasm. “We’re really confident and optimistic
        about this record.”
      </p>
      <p>
        That emotion also spreads far beyond the band themselves. Named after
        an early Kodaline song, the High Hopes choir uses music as a way for
        homeless people to change their lives through music. More recently,
        Voices of Service, an American soul group consisting of military
        veterans, have released a gospel version of ‘Brother’. And that early
        hit ‘All I Want’ is still being discovered, with countless fans
        embracing it as a song that helps them through a grieving process.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s the power of Kodaline. They’re four regular people who explore
        topics that everyone experiences. That also inspires a wider community
        in their following, with fans becoming life-long friends with people
        they meet at the band’s shows.
      </p>
      <p>
        “We want to do this for the rest of our lives,” concludes May. “We
        want to continue to grow and reach a wider audience. That ambition has
        been there from the start and is still there now.”
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s a cheeky glint in his eye and laughter all-round as he
        summarises the Kodaline story so far. “We’re lucky fuckers!”
